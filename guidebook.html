    To begin, simply enable your location in your default browser. An audio story will pop up if you happen to be at a point of New York City where a frustrating date took place. You can listen to the story by clicking the play button. If you are in a noisy place (like most bars in NYC), you can read about the story in text by clicking the "Read in text" button.
