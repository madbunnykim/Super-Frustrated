			"text"			: "I think he lived in Manhattan, which felt so mystifying to me. He took the East River Ferry over to Brooklyn. I know this because he texted a picture with, “Beautiful sunset from the East River Ferry. Be there soon!!!!” and made me momentarily second guess leaving my house. I showed up at my favorite neighborhood bar looking forward to my preferred first date incentive: a homemade pina colada on the back porch. That’s when I saw it. This guy was standing in the middle of my neighborhood bar, on a Segway. When I walked up to him, he towered over me on it. He looked down at me and we shook hands. And to my horror, he rode it out to the back porch, trying to match my walking pace. Seeing my face, he admitted that his friends recommended he not show up on a first date on a Segway. I disagreed. “Actually,” I said, “I think it’s a great idea.” I envisioned a woman rolling up to the date on her own Segway and the two of them collapsing in fits of laughter, relieved that, finally, they had both found the one. The pair, gliding off into their promising future, perfecting their Segway’s pace so that they can still hold hands. I was jolted back to reality as I watched him methodically collapse it, attracting a few looks. I liked his self-assurance, though! This guy clearly knew who he was and what he liked. I really wanted to give him a shot. But his story dominated mine. He spent the duration of the drink talking about the all the property he owned. He cut off my sentences like he cut off foot traffic inside the bar, steering the conversation in whatever direction the urge took him. As I looked at my watch, he asked, before I left, did I want to ride it? I paused. I never wanted to see this human-who-cuts-women-off again. But, I wasn’t certain that I’d get another chance to ride a Segway. And so I did, in the nearby parking lot. In public. It was just alright. And then I got the hell out of there. I immediately called my best friend, Nancy, and explained to her what had happened in a breathless run on sentence. Just as she was getting the gist, I heard “Heyyy!”. I froze. There he was, rolling right on by, calling out to me on my street, the sidewalk cafe-goers barely looking up from their pints."
