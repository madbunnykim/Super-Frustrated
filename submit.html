  <h1>Super Frustrated NYC Modern Love Stories</h1>
  <h3>Are you a millennial struggling to find love in NYC?</h3>
  <h3>
    Take out your phone, turn on your audio recorder, and talk about one of your most frustrating NYC dating stories. 3-5 minute, with an intro describing the location (e.g. After taking an afternoon stroll in Soho, he suggested that we go to Prince Street Pizza. I was like sure even though I am not that crazy about pizza. We immediately saw a line outside of the restaurant as we walk towards the intersection of Prince and Elizabeth.)
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Once you're done, share your audio file with me at <a href="mailto:kimberly.yc.lin@gmail.com" style="color: rgb(255,255,255)">kimberly.yc.lin@gmail.com</a>.
